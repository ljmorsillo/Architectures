# RomanArchitectures

Code to translate integers to Roman Numerals and vice versa. C# coding exercise, expanded.

*[ ] Convert integer to Roman Numerals - as library

*[ ] Convert number in Roman Numerals to integer - as library

*[ ] Build continuous Integration - dockerize - see https://github.com/ligurio/awesome-ci and https://www.peterdavehello.org/2015/10/online-continuous-integration-services-for-free/

*[ ] Create Web Service - Microsoft Azure

*[ ] Fractional Conversions - Don't know if this is even possible, research this


Integer to Roman Numeral translations in various architectures - such as a .Net based web service, linkable library for stand alone app, AWS Lambda code.

Not anything of great practical use except as example code for the architectures I am exploring. Ideally it will also serve as an example of good coding style and practices.
